\section{Inference}
\label{sec:inference}
\todo[inline]{Just a short section sketching how to carry out inference. Show the GMM conditions, talk about how to use them. Perhaps cite Lewbel (2005) so that we can handle covariates. Mention that there is a weak identification problem when $\beta$ is small. Mention that one possible way to address this is to use tools from the moment inequality literature. Refer to our NBER working paper for more details.}
