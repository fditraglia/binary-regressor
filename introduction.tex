\section{Introduction}

Measurement error and endogeneity are pervasive features of economic data.
Conveniently, a valid instrumental variable corrects for both problems when the measurement error is classical, i.e.\ uncorrelated with the truth.
Many regressors of interest in applied work, however, are binary and thus cannot be subject to classical measurement error.\footnote{The only way to mis-classify a true one is downwards, as a zero, while the only way to mis-classify a true zero is upwards, as a one. This creates negative dependence between the truth and the error.}
When faced with non-classical measurement error, the instrumental variables estimator can be severely biased.
In this paper, we study an additively separable model of the form
\begin{equation}
  y = c(\mathbf{x}) + \beta(\mathbf{x}) T^* + \varepsilon
  \label{eq:model}
\end{equation}
where $\varepsilon$ is a mean-zero error term, $T^*$ is a binary regressor of interest and $\mathbf{x}$ is a vector of exogenous controls.\footnote{Because $T^*$ is binary, there is no loss of generality from writing the model in this form rather than the more familiar $y = h(T^*,\mathbf{x})+\varepsilon$. Simply define $\beta(\mathbf{x}) = h(1,\mathbf{x}) - h(0,\mathbf{x})$ and $c(\mathbf{x}) = h(0,\mathbf{x})$.}
Our question is whether, and if so under what conditions, a discrete instrumental variable $z$ suffices to non-parametrically identify the causal effect $\beta(\mathbf{x})$ of $T^*$, when we observe not $T^*$ itself but a mis-classified binary surrogate $T$. 

We proceed under the assumption of non-differential measurement error.
This condition has been widely used in the existing literature and imposes, roughly speaking, that $T$ provides no additional information beyond that contained in $(T^*,\mathbf{x})$.
Even in this fairly standard setting, identification remains an open question.
We begin by showing that the only existing identification result for this model is incorrect.
We then go on to derive the sharp identified set under the standard first-moment assumptions from the related literature.
We show that regardless of the number of values that $z$ takes on, the model is not point identified.
This motivates us to consider alternative, and slightly stronger assumptions.
We show that, given a binary instrument, the addition of a second moment independence assumption suffices to identify a model with one-sided mis-classification.
Adding a second moment restriction on the measurement error along with a third moment independence assumption for the instrument suffices to identify the model in general.
This result likewise requires only a binary $z$.

We then turn our attention to inference, showing that both our model and related models from the literature that assume an exogenous regressor suffer from a weak identification problem. 
In essence, binary mis-classification creates a mixture model and to correct the bias in the instrumental variables estimator, we must estimate the mixing probabilities.
But when $\beta(\mathbf{x})$ is small the ``mixture modes'' are nearly indistinguishable, so that it becomes impossible to reliably estimate these probabilities.
To address this difficulty, we exploit the inequality moment restrictions that emerge from our derivation of the sharp identified set.
These restrictions remain informative even when $\beta(\mathbf{x})$ is small or zero.
Combining them with the moment equalities that emerge from our identification result, we propose a robust inference procedure using tools from the moment inequality literature.
Our procedure is computationally attractive and performs well in simulations.
Moreover, it can be used both in our model and related models from the literature that assume an exogenous $T^*$. 

Our work relates to a large literature studying departures from the textbook linear, classical measurement error setting.
One strand of this literature considers relaxing the assumption of linearity while maintaining that of classical measurement error.
\cite{schennach2004}, for example, uses repeated measures of each mis-measured regressor to obtain identification, while \cite{schennach2007} uses an instrumental variable.  
More recently, \cite{SongSchennachWhite} rely on a repeated measure of the mis-measured regressor and the existence of a set of additional regressors, conditional upon which the regressor of interest is unrelated to the unobservables, to obtain identification.      
For comprehensive reviews of the challenges of addressing measurement error in non-linear models, see  \cite{chensurvey} and \cite{SchennachSurvey}.
Another strand of the literature considers relaxing the assumption of classical measurement error, by allowing the measurement error to be related to the true value of the unobserved regressor.
\cite{ChenHongTamer} obtain identification in a general class of moment condition models with mis-measured data by relying on the existence of an auxiliary dataset from which they can estimate the measurement error process.
In contrast, \cite{HuSchennach} and \cite{song2015} rely on an instrumental variable and an additional conditional location assumption on the measurement error distribution. 
More recently, \cite{HuShiuWoutersen} use a continuous instrument to identify the ratio of partial effects of two continuous regressors, one measured with error, in a linear single index model.
Unfortunately, these approaches cannot be applied to the case of a mis-measured binary regressor.

A number of papers have studied models with an exogenous binary regressor subject to non-differential measurement error.\footnote{As defined above, non-differential measurement error assumes that $T$ provides no additional information beyond that already contained in $(T^*,\mathbf{x})$.}
One group of papers asks what can be learned without recourse to an instrumental variable.
An early contribution by \cite{Aigner} characterizes the asymptotic bias of OLS in this setting, and proposes a correction using outside information on the mis-classification process.
Related work by \cite{Bollinger} provides partial identification bounds.
More recently, \cite{ChenHuLewbel} use higher moment assumptions to obtain identification in a linear model, and \cite{ChenHuLewbel2} extend these results to the non-parametric setting. 
\cite{HasseltBollinger} and \cite{BollingerHasseltWP} provide additional partial identification results.
For results on the partial identification of discrete probability distributions under mis-classification, see \cite{molinari}.

Continuing under the assumption of exogeneity and non-differential measurement error, another group of papers relies on the availability of either an instrumental variable or a second measure of $T^*$.
\cite{BBS} and \cite{KRS} consider a linear model and show that when \emph{two} alternative measures $T_1$ and $T_2$ of $T^*$ are available, a non-linear GMM estimator can be used to recover the effect of interest.
Subsequently, \cite{FL} note that an instrumental variable can take the place of one of the measures.
\cite{Mahajan} extends the results of \cite{BBS} and \cite{KRS} to a more general setting using a binary instrument in place of one of the treatment measures, establishing non-parametric identification of the conditional mean function.
When the $T^*$ is in fact exogenous, this coincides with the causal effect.
\cite{hu2008} derives related results when the mis-classified discrete regressor may take on more than two values.
\cite{Lewbel} provides an identification result for the same model as \cite{Mahajan} under different assumptions.
In particular, his ``instrument-like variable'' need not satisfy the usual  exclusion restriction so long as it does not interact with $T^*$ and takes on three or more values.

Much less is known about the case in which a binary, or discrete, regressor is not only mis-classified but endogenous.
The first paper to provide a formal result for this case is \cite{Mahajan}.
He extends his main result to the case of an endogenous treatment, providing an explicit proof of identification under the usual IV assumption in a model with additively separable errors.
As we show below, however, this argument is incorrect.
Several more recent papers also consider the case of a mis-classified, endogenous, binary regressor.
\cite{kreider2012}, partially identify the effects of food stamps on health outcomes of children under weak measurement error assumptions by relying on auxiliary data.
Similarly, \cite{Batt} study the returns to schooling in a setting with multiple mis-reported measures of educational qualifications.
Unlike these two papers, our approach does not depend on the availability of auxiliary data.
In a different vein, \cite{shiu2015} uses an exclusion restriction for the participation equation and an additional valid instrument to identify the effect of a discrete, mis-classified endogenous regressor in a semi-parametric selection model.
Similarly, \cite{nguimkeu2016estimation} use exclusion restrictions for both the participation equation and measurement error equation to identify a parametric model with endogenous participation and one-sided endogenous mis-reporting. 
Unlike those of the preceding two papers, our results rely neither on parametric assumptions nor additional exclusion restrictions.
Other than \cite{Mahajan}, paper most closely related to our own is that of \cite{Ura}, who derives partial identification results for a local average treatment effect without assuming non-differential measurement error.
Unlike \cite{Ura} we study an additively separable model under non-differential measurement error and derive both partial and point identification results.

Our work also relates to a large literature on inference using inequality moment conditions.
In particular, we adopt the generalized moment selection (GMS) approach of \cite{AndrewsSoares} to construct a procedure for identification-robust inference that combines the moment equalities from our point identification results with inequalities from our partial identification results.
Although the equalities alone globally identify our model, the inequalities turn out to be extremely valuable in settings where $\beta(\mathbf{x})$ may be small. 
Although our specific approach differs from theirs, the idea of including moment inequalities in a model that is already point identified by a collection of moment equalities relates to work by \cite{moon2009estimation}. 
While the weak identification problem that we point out and address here also emerges in several closely related models, e.g.\ \citep{Mahajan} and \cite{FL}, we are unaware of any other work from the literature that acknowledges or addresses it.
As shown in Appendix \ref{sec:FL_mahajan}, our inference procedure can be applied to the case of an exogenous regressor with only minor modifications.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

Section \ref{sec:problem} points out the special inferential difficulties that arise in models with mis-classification while Section \ref{sec:overview} gives a high-level overview of our proposed inference procedure.
Full details of the procedure follow in Sections \ref{sec:inequalities}--\ref{sec:details}.
Section \ref{sec:simulation} presents simulation results, and Section \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes.
Proofs appear in Appendix \ref{sec:proofs}, and we give a detailed explanation of the error in \cite{Mahajan} in Appendix \ref{sec:mahajan}.
