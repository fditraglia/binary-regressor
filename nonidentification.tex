\section{Nonidentification}

\paragraph{Mahajan}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Show that Mahajan's Assumption in Equation (11) implies the condition on the $m$ that we claimed.
  \item Show why he needs to use this assumption in order to apply his proof for the exogenous case. 
  \item Show why this assumption implies that there is no first stage.
  \item Point out where exactly the dependency condition is needed in the proof for the exogenous case.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Extending the Support of the Instrument:}
Prove that the system is not identified regardless of the value of $K$ by transcribing our notes from the whiteboard.
