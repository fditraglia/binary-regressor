\section{Nonidentification}

\subsection{Mahajan's Argument}
Here we show that \citeauthor{Mahajan}'s proof of identification for an endogenous treatment is incorrect.
The problem is subtle so we give his argument in full detail.
We continue to supress dependence on the exogenous covariates $\mathbf{x}$.

The first step of the argument is to show that if one could recover the conditional mean function of $y$ given $T^*$, then a valid and relevant binary instrument would suffice to identify the treatment effect.  
\begin{assump}[Mahajan A2]\mbox{}
  \label{assump:A2} Suppose that $y = c+ \beta T^* + \varepsilon$ where
  \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    \item $\mathbb{E}[\varepsilon|z]=0$
    \item $\mathbb{P}(T^*=1|z_1)\neq \mathbb{P}(T^*=1|z_2)$
    \item $\mathbb{P}(T = 1| T^* = 0, z) = \alpha_0$, $\mathbb{P}(T = 0| T^* = 1, z) = \alpha_1$
    \item $\alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \neq 1$
  \end{enumerate}
\end{assump}

\begin{res}[Mahajan A2]
  \label{res:A2}
Under Assumption \ref{assump:A2}, knowledge of the mis-classification error rates $\alpha_0, \alpha_1$ suffices to identify $\beta$.
\end{res}
\begin{proof}[Proof of Proposition \ref{res:A2}]
Since $z$ is a valid instrument that does not influence the mis-classification probabilities
\[\mathbb{E}[y|z_k] = c + \beta \mathbb{E}[T^*|z_k] + \mathbb{E}[\varepsilon|z_k] = c + \beta p_k^* = c + \beta \left( \frac{p_k - \alpha_0}{1 - \alpha_0 - \alpha_1} \right)\]
by Equation \ref{eq:pkstar}.
Since $p_k$ is observed, and $z$ takes on two values, this is a system of two linear equations in $c,\beta$ provided that $\alpha_0,\alpha_1$ are known.
A unique solution exists if and only if $p_1 \neq p_2$.
\end{proof}
In his Theorem 1, \cite{Mahajan} proves that $\alpha_0, \alpha_1$ can in fact be identified under the following assumptions.\footnote{Technically, one additional assumption is required, namely that the conditional mean of $y$ given $T^*$ and any covariates would be identified if $T^*$ were observed.}

\citeauthor{Mahajan}'s next step is to argue that $\alpha_0,\alpha_1$ can be identified by applying his Theorem 1.
\begin{assump}[Mahajan A1] Define $\nu = y - \mathbb{E}[y|T^*]$ so that by construction we have $\mathbb{E}[\nu|T^*]=0$. Assume that
  \label{assump:A1}
  \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    \item $\mathbb{E}[\nu|T^*,T,z] = 0$.\footnote{This is \citeauthor{Mahajan}'s Equation (I).}
    \item $\mathbb{P}(T^*=1|z_1)\neq \mathbb{P}(T^*=1|z_2)$
    \item $\mathbb{P}(T = 1| T^* = 0, z) = \alpha_0$,  $\mathbb{P}(T = 0| T^* = 1, z) = \alpha_1$
    \item $\alpha_0 + \alpha_1 < 1$
    \item $\mathbb{E}[y|T^*=0]\neq \mathbb{E}[y|T^*=1]$
  \end{enumerate}
\end{assump}
\begin{thm}[Mahajan Theorem 1]
  \label{thm:1}
  Under Assumptions \ref{assump:A1}, the mis-classification error rates $\alpha_0, \alpha_1$ are identified as is the conditional mean function $\mathbb{E}[y|T^*]$.
\end{thm}

Notice that the identification of the error rates in \ref{thm:1} does not depend on the interpretation of the conditional mean function $\mathbb{E}[y|T^*]$.
If $T^*$ is an exogenous treatment, the conditional mean coincides with the treatment effect; if it is endogenous, this is not the case.
Nevertheless, the interpretation of $\alpha_0, \alpha_1$ does not depend on whether we can give the conditional mean a causal interpretation.
Based on this observation, \cite{Mahajan} claims that he can rely on \ref{thm:1} to identify $\alpha_0,\alpha_1$ and thus the causal effect $\beta$ via Result \ref{res:A2}.
To do this, he must build a bridge between Assumption \ref{assump:A2} and Assumption \ref{assump:A1} that allows $T^*$ to be endogenous.
\cite{Mahajan} does this by imposing one additional assumption: Equation 11 in his paper.
\begin{assump}[Mahajan Equation 11]
  \label{assump:Eq11}
  Let $y = c + \beta T^* + \varepsilon$ where $\mathbb{E}[\varepsilon|T^*]$ may not be zero and suppose that 
  \[\mathbb{E}[\varepsilon|T^*,T,z] = \mathbb{E}[\varepsilon|T^*]\]
  where $\mathbb{E}[\varepsilon|T^*]$ may not be zero.
\end{assump}
\begin{res}
  \label{res:Eq11}
  Suppose that $y = c + \beta T^* + \varepsilon$ where $E[\varepsilon|z]=0$ and define the unobserved projection error $\nu = y - \mathbb{E}[y|T^*]$.
  Then Assumption \ref{assump:Eq11} implies that $E[\nu|T^*,T,z]=0$, which is Assumption \ref{assump:A1}(i).
\end{res}
\begin{proof}[Proof of Result \ref{res:Eq11}]
  Taking conditional expectations of the causal model,
  \[\mathbb{E}[y|T^*] = c + \beta T^* + \mathbb{E}[\varepsilon|T^*]\]
  which implies that 
  \[\nu = y - c - \beta T^* - \mathbb{E}[\varepsilon|T^*] = \varepsilon - \mathbb{E}[\varepsilon|T^*].\]
  Now, taking conditional expectations of both sides given $T^*,T,z$, we see that 
  \begin{align*}
  \mathbb{E}[\nu|T^*,T,z]&= \mathbb{E}[\varepsilon|T^*,T,z] - \mathbb{E}\left[ \mathbb{E}\left( \left.\varepsilon\right|T^* \right)\left. \right| T,T^*,z \right]\\
  &= \mathbb{E}[\varepsilon|T^*,T,z] - \mathbb{E}\left[ \left.\varepsilon\right|T^* \right] = 0
\end{align*}
by Assumption \ref{assump:Eq11}, since $\mathbb{E}[\varepsilon|T^*]$ is $(T^*,T,z)$--measurable.
\end{proof}

To summarize, Mahajan's claim is equivalent to the proposition that under Assumptions \ref{assump:A2}(i), \ref{assump:A1}(ii)--(v), and \ref{assump:Eq11}, $\beta$ is identified even if $T^*$ is endogenous.
