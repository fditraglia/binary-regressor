\subsection{Identification Based on Higher Moments}
Having shown that the moment conditions from Table \ref{tab:observables} do not identify $\beta$ regardless of the value of $K$, we now consider exploiting the information contained in higher moments of $y$. 
When $z$ is not merely mean-independent but in fact \emph{statistically} independent of $\varepsilon$, as in a randomized controlled trial or a true natural experiment, the following assumptions hold automatically.
\begin{assump}[Second Moment Independence]
  $\mathbb{E}[\varepsilon^2|z]=\mathbb{E}[\varepsilon^2]$
  \label{assump:homosked}
\end{assump}
\begin{assump}[Third Moment Independence]
  $\mathbb{E}[\varepsilon^3|z]=\mathbb{E}[\varepsilon^3]$
  \label{assump:skew}
\end{assump}
%When combined with the usual IV assumption, $\mathbb{E}[u|z]=0$, Assumption \ref{assump:homosked} implies that $Var(\varepsilon|z) = Var(\varepsilon)$.
%Whether this assumption is reasonable, naturally, depends on the application.
%When $z$ is the offer of treatment in a randomized controlled trial, for example, Assumption \ref{assump:homosked} holds automatically as a consequence of the randomization.
%Similarly, in studies based on a ``natural'' rather than a controlled experiment, one typically argues that the instrument is not merely uncorrelated with the error term but \emph{independent} of it, so that Assumption \ref{assump:homosked} follows.
\begin{thm}
  \label{pro:homosked}
  Under Assumption \ref{assump:homosked} and the conditions of Theorem \ref{pro:Lack} the difference of mis-classification rates, $(\alpha_1 - \alpha_0)$ is identified provided that $z$ takes on at least two values.
\end{thm}

The preceding result can be used in several ways.
One possibility is to test for the presence of mis-classification error.
If the treatment is measured without error, then $\alpha_0$ must equal $\alpha_1$.
By examining the identified quantities $\mathcal{R}$ and $\mathcal{W}$, one could possibly discover that this requirement it violated.\footnote{Note that Theorem \ref{pro:homosked} requires $\alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \neq 1$, since the Wald estimator would otherwise be undefined. Accordingly, we cannot test for measurement error in the non-generic case $\alpha_0 = \alpha_1 = 1/2$.}
Moreover, in some settings mis-classification may be one-sided.
In a smoking and birthweight example, it seems unlikely that mothers who did \emph{not} smoke during pregnancy would falsely claim to have smoked.
If either of $\alpha_0, \alpha_1$ is known, Theorem \ref{pro:homosked} point identifies the unknown error rate and hence $\beta$, using the fact that $\beta=\mathcal{W}(1-\alpha_0-\alpha_1)$.
When neither of the error rates is known \emph{a priori}, the same basic idea can be used to construct \emph{bounds} for $\beta$.
We now show that by augmenting Theorem \ref{pro:homosked} with information on conditional \emph{third} moments, we can point identify $\beta$.

\begin{thm}
  \label{thm:skew}
  Under Assumptions \ref{assump:homosked}-\ref{assump:skew} and the conditions of Theorem \ref{pro:Lack}, the mis-classification rates $\alpha_0$ and $\alpha_1$ and the treatment effect $\beta$ are identified provided that $\alpha_0 + \alpha_1 < 1$ and $z$ takes on at least two values.
\end{thm}


Note that, unlike Theorem \ref{pro:homosked}, Theorem \ref{thm:skew} requires the assumption that $\alpha_0 + \alpha_1 < 1$.
Without this assumption, we identify $\beta$ only up to sign.
