This paper studies the use of a discrete instrumental variable to identify the effect of a binary, endogenous regressor that is subject to non-differential measurement error.
We begin by showing that the only existing identification result for this case is incorrect.
As such, identification in this model remains an open question.
We then show that the model is unidentified under the usual mean independence assumption for the instrument and measurement error.
This motivates us to consider alternative and slightly stronger forms of independence.
Our main result shows that adding second and third moment independence assumptions suffices to identify the model.
We also derive a number of partial identification results under different forms of independence. 
Our identification result leads to an explicit method of moments estimator. 
Like a number of related estimators from the literature, however, it suffers from a weak identification problem when the regressor has only a small effect on the outcome of interest. 
To address this difficulty, we propose a two-step inference procedure that combines our moment equalities with partially-identifying moment inequalities.
