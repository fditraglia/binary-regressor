This paper studies identification and estimation of the effect of a binary, endogenous regressor subject to non-differential measurement error when a discrete-valued instrumental variable is available. 
We begin by showing that the only existing identification result for this case is incorrect. 
As such, identification in this model remains an open question. 
We then show that the usual mean independence assumption for the instrument and measurement error fail to identify the effect of interest. 
This motivates us to consider alternative and slightly stronger assumptions. 
We show that adding second and third moment independence assumptions suffices to identify the model and leads to an explicit method of moments estimator. 
Because our setting has features of a mixture model, however, this estimator suffers from a weak identification problem when the binary regressor has only a small effect on the outcome of interest. 
To address this difficulty, we derive a number of auxiliary moment inequalities that remain informative regardless of the magnitude of the treatment effect. 
Combining these with the moment equalities that emerge from our identification result, we propose a robust inference procedure based on generalized moment selection.
