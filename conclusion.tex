\section{Conclusion}

\todo[inline]{Flesh out the following outline:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Point and partial identification results for mis-classified, endogenous, binary regressor using a binary instrument.
  \item Showed existing point identification result is false, derived sharp identified set under existing assumptions, derived point identification under stronger condition on instrument.
  \item Inference is complicated by weak identification etc.
    Showed how to carry out valid inference using moment equalities from point identification result along with inequalities from partial identification result.
    Perform well in simulations.
  \item Extensions/Future work: general discrete endogenous regressor. Not a trivial extension. Also may be interesting to think about the transition from robust to standard inference in moment inequality models.
    \cite{andrews2016valid} gives results for GMM but not moment inequalities.
\end{itemize}
