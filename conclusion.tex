\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper has studied identification and inference for a mis-classified, binary, endogenous regressor in an additively separable model using a discrete instrumental variable.
We have shown that the only existing identification result for this model is incorrect, and gone on to derive the sharp identified set under standard first-moment assumptions from the literature.
Strengthening these assumptions to hold for second and third moments, we have established point identification for the effect of interest.
A interesting extension of the results presented above would be to consider the case of discrete regressors that take on more than two values.
