Documentation for "draftCPS.csv"

"draftCPS.csv" is exported from "extract.dta".  
"extract.dta" is the extracted CPS data used in the Angrist and Krueger article (1995, JBES).
I downloaded "extract.dta" from http://economics.mit.edu/faculty/angrist/data1/data/angkru95 on 31 May 2015.

"year": CPS years (79, 81, 82, 83, 84, or 85)
